### Problem 1:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

Output: [0,1]

Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6

Output: [0,1]

### Problem 2:

Given a string s containing characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']' determine if the string is valid

An input string is valid if: Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Example 1:

Input: s = "()"

Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "(]"

Output: false

### Problem 3:
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

Output: [1,2]

Explaination: 1 is first most frequent and 2 is second most frequent

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1

Output: [1]
